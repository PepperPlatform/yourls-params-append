# yourls-params-append
Append Params to urls generated by YOURLS (a url shortener)


This plugin adds functionality which allows you to add some parameters after the url. This assumes a platform will be created and then for that platform, some parameters are added.
For example, you may pick Facebook as platform and then use the parameters ?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=171221.

Now when adding a new url to the url shortener, you won't have to type those parameters again, just select Facebook on the options and the params will be appended to the url you like to shorten.

That's it.


#Installation

You will need to dump the `init.sql` into your database so that plugin works as expected.

create a folder `/user/plugins/yourls-params-append` and dump the files in there. Then use the admin section to activate the plugin.
